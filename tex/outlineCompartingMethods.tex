\section{Comparing}
The methods described above to find the moment where the noise is revealed
will be compared. We will look for differences and advantages of those methods, in special
how predicted noise level changes with the $k_{noise}$ acquired by the Normalized Cumulative
Periodogram and the method described in \cite{bidiagonalization}. To get the noise $\delta_{noise}$
level we are going to use 
\begin{equation*}
	\delta_{noise} = \frac{\|b^{noise}\|}{\|b^{exact}\|} \approx \frac{1}{2}\rho_{k_{noise}},
\end{equation*}
as described on section 4.2 of \cite{bidiagonalization}.
